//How to make a tyescript project from begginning.

1. Make a folder and initialize your typescript project using command "npm init -y" in cmd, it will make (package.json) file in your root directory.
2. Now run the command "tsc --init", it will create (tsconfig.json) file in you root directory.
3. Open your project in VScode and make Q1.ts file and run the above code respectively.
4. When you're done with writing your code, go to terminal and run "tsc"
5. the "tsc" command in your terminal will transpile Q1.ts "typescript file" into Q1.js "javascript file", because browser only understand js.
6. Lastly, Run the command "node Q1" and so on like node Q2, node Q3 respectively to run your program in the terminal.
